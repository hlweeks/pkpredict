#Notes

Actually, I haven't implemented this next bullet point yet. I would like to revisit it, since I think it feel more intuitive to force people to supply values on the mcg/mL (measurement) scale and manually convert within the function, rather than making them do the conversion on their own. It also seems more intuitive to enter "6 g/h" than to have to do "6,000 mg/h"  

* A note on units: functions have been recoded to have all inputs on the scale of interest: mcg/mL (**VERIFY** - we used to be providing information on the scale of mcg/mL then multiplying the pk solution by 1000 for unit compatibility. Now, we are forcing people to enter ...(rate?)... as mcg/mL)  


##Reminders  

* Change `cod` argument name to something more intuitive  
* Rename `pk_basic_solution` and `pk_solution` to more clearly delineate the difference  
* Come back to `log_prior`: Current have default values both coded into the function and as an example. Probably don't need both.  


##Questions  

* Rearrange prior/model function to depend on supplied mean/sd of distribution (not positive what distribution I meant here...)  
* How to structure the hyperparameters? Would draws from the hyperpriors be made within the log_prior function? (for a later version)
