* Make ivt helper function to convert vectors to list    
* How to deal with units in our functions? The fact that time is in hours, conversion from g/L to micrograms/mL, `dat` in hours and micrograms/mL  
* In `confint` method for mic stat - what SE to return? Using `fdGrad` on original scale? Or SE on logit scale (used for intervals)? Or just CIs?  
* Is it ok to make a `confint` method even though these are credible bands?  
* Rearrange prior/model function to depend on supplied mean/sd of distribution  
* How to structure the hyperparameters? Would draws from the hyperpriors be made within the log_prior function?  
* What exactly is the role of the optim object? For a new problem, are the only parameters that need to be changed at this point the ivt and dat objects? Are the lpr_mean_d values the "default" hyperparameters?


```
est <- optim(lpr_mean_d, log_posterior, ivt=ivt,
             dat=dat, control = list(fnscale=-1), hessian=TRUE)
```

Aside  
* What do the hyperpriors mean biologically?
